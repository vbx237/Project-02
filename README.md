Scripting in Bash

A summary of what I did for this project is located at (username blocked out in images):

There were at least 2 commands I couldn't use, cal and man. I also didn't experiment much with the backup.sh because I didn't have the exact directories as the tutorial and I need more practice with paths.

I was also under a different username throughout the process which is why I had to block the username out.

# Code Review Norma Mathis. Formatting was consistent throughout the code. There were no errors when I ran the code.
# I would suggest changing the name of the for loop file to for.sh for consistency with the other loop files.
